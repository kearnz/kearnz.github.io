The researchers develop and maintain an open-source, Python-based package named Autoimpute to address one of the most common nuisances in machine learning â€“ datasets with missing values. The package implements numerous imputation algorithms and extends common supervised machine learning methods to handle multiply imputed datasets. Autoimpute treats missing data as a first-class citizen in the Python world, making imputation familiar to Python developers and easy to use for those new to the language. Ultimately, the package provides users an end-to-end framework that covers missing data exploration to imputation analysis.
