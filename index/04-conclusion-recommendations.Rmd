# Conclusion {.unnumbered}

In summary, this project examines the nature of missingness and provides an end-to-end methodology for missing data & imputation analysis. It focuses on four key objectives: describe and visualize the extent of the missing value problem; examine factors related to missingness; develop methods to impute missing data; and measure the impact of imputation on inference derived from supervised learning, specifically linear regression. The researchers create a open-source, Python-based package called Autoimpute to accomplish these objectives. The Autoimpute package provides methods to explore missingness, implement imputation methods, and analyze their impact on analytical models in a flexible way. This report specifically focuses on establishing a solid foundation around the concepts missing data & imputation and demonstrates examples of missing data analysis with different types of missing data. Ultimately, this research provides python-focused data practitioners a tool to use to explore missingness in their datasets, perform imputation methods, and assess the impact of imputation on analytical models downstream. 

# Recommendations {.unnumbered}

This research explores missingness and outlines a framework through which a data practitioner can conduct missing data and imputation analysis. The researchers recommend data practitioners use the flexibility, simplicity, and granularity of the Autoimpute package to conduct their own missing data analyses. To start, data practitioners should review the Autoimpute package tutorials (See Appendix A.0) and get a better understanding of how the package works. This will help data practitioners follow best practices when utilizing the package. Once that is clear, data practitioners should clone the publicly available package from GitHub (See Appendix A.0) and start their analyses. If issues arise during your analyses, please contact the researchers. Lastly, the researchers ask that you share your feedback about the Autoimpute package or any interesting results you find in your analyses.
