# Background {#background .unnumbered}

One must understand what missingness means and why it exists before one decides how to handle it. The authors explore concepts related to missingness using a motivating example. For an experiment, assume that a random sample of measurements is collected from thousands of weigh scales. Also assume each weigh scale in the experiment may fail to produce measurements for three separate reasons. First, a scale might run out of batteries, in which case all measurements from that scale cease for a given period of time. Next, a scale may fail more frequently for heavier objects or items over a certain weight threshhold. And finally, a scale may stop reporting measurements when placed on a soft surface instead of a hard one (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 1.2). 

As a result of these scenarios, the random sample collected likely has many instances in which weight measurements are unobserved. How missingness in this sample is handled moving forward will depend on characteristics of the missing data itself and the process that generated missingess. The authors devote the rest of this section to concepts related to the nature of missingness and how it is handled. The authors refer back to this example to make concepts more concrete.

## Basic Terminology and Notation {#background-basic-terms .unnumbered}

Before diving into concepts related to missingness, the authors establish notation used throughout this text. In doing so, the authors also introduce some basic terminology. This research follows the notation Van Buuren uses in the second edition of his book, Flexible Imputation of Missing Data. For more information, refer to Appendix B, which collects and summarizes the notation seen throughout this research.

In the introductory example, weigh scales produce a set of $n$ measurements, some of which may be missing weight. $Y$ denotes the $n$ x $p$ matrix that contains the $n$ measurements and the $p$ variables recorded along with the measurements. The surface of the scale (hard or soft) is an example of a discrete variable in $p$, while the weight measurement itself is a continuous variable in $p$. We can retrieve an observation within $Y$ by specifying the row and column index corresponding to the observation's cell. To do so, we use the notation $y_{ij}$, where $i$ represents the row and $j$ represents the column associated with a scalar $y$ in matrix $Y$. 

$Y$ itself represents the hypothetically complete data (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 2.2.3), which is comprised of $Y_{obs}$ and $Y_{mis}$. $Y_{obs}$ represents each row $Y_i$ out of $n$ records that have known values for each column $Y_j$ in $p$. $Y_{mis}$, on the other hand, contains records with missing observations across any of the columns in $p$. Note that $Y = (Y_{obs}, Y_{mis})$. The hypothetically complete data equals the conjoined observed and missing data matrices.

It is convenient to store whether or not a cell in $Y$ is missing in a separate matrix $R$. Therefore, $R$ is an $n$ by $p$ matrix where all entries $r_{ij} \in {0, 1}$. Any observation $r_{ij}=1$ corresponds to a known value for $y_{ij}$. On the contrary, any observation $r_{ij}=0$ corresponds to a missing value for $y_{ij}$. $R$ is commonly referred to as the **missing indicator matrix**, while $Y$ is the **complete data matrix** (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 2.2.3).

## Missing Data Mechanism {#background-missing-data-mech  .unnumbered} 

Each of the three scenarios discussed above causes a given weigh scale to produce missing data, but the underlying reason for missingness is quite different in each case. Donald Rubin describes the ways in which data can be missing (Rubin, 1976). According to Rubin (as cited in Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 1.2), every observation in a dataset has some probability of being missing. The process that governs these probabilities is called the **missing data mechanism** (Rubin, as cited in Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 1.2). The missing data mechanism generates a statistical relationship between observations and the probability of missing data (Nakagawa, 2015, pg. 83). The **missing data model** is the function that formalizes that statistical relationship (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 2.2.4). These statistical relationships fall into one of three categories, each of which represents a different missing data mechanism (Rubin, as cited in Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 1.2).

The general expression for the missing data model is defined as: 

$$P(R|Y_{obs}, Y_{mis},\psi)$$

$\psi$ cointains the parameters of the missing data model. This expression notes that the probability of missingness $P(R=0)$ within a dataset depends on the observed data, the missing data, and the missing data model's parameters. (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 2.2.4). From another lense, this expession states that the missing data model is the distribution of the missingness indicator conditional on the observed data, the missing data, and the parameters of the missing data model. 

The missing data model is the function that formalizes the statistical relationship governed by a missing data mechanism. The next section examines the manifestation of the missing data model under each mechanism.

### MCAR, MAR, and MNAR {#background-mcar-mar-mnar .unnumbered} 

Rubin popularized names for the three categories that represent the main missing data mechanisms:

* **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**
* **Missing at Random (MAR)**
* **Missing Not at Random (MNAR)**

In this research, the authors refer to each category by its abbreviated label. The subsections below examine each category in more detail.

#### Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)

MCAR is the first of the three missing data mechanisms. MCAR assumes missing values in the underlying dataset have the same probability of missingness for all cases (Gelman & Hill, 2017, pg. 530). Thus, MCAR implies that the probability of missingness within a dataset is completely unrelated to the data in question or any other observed or unobserved data. The missing data model 
associated with MCAR is defined as:

$$P(R=0|Y_{obs},Y_{mis},\psi) = P(R=0|\psi)$$

Note that the general expression of the missing data model reduces to a much simpler form. Under MCAR, the probability of data being missing depends on the parameters of the missing data only and not on the values of missing data itself or the value of any of the observed data (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 2.2.4).

From the weigh scale example, MCAR governs the probability of values being missing from a scale that runs out of batteries at some point in time (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 1.2). For simplicity, assume time is not a latent variable nor of interest in the data collection process. In this case then, the missing values produced from the scale do not depend on the weight of the object in question nor the surface used for the scale, so the probability a value is missing does not depend on any of the missing or observed data. Although MCAR is convenient, it is very restrictive and generally unrealistic, so datasets with missing values are often not MCAR in the real world (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 2.2.4).

#### Missing at Random (MAR)

MAR is the second missing data mechanism. MAR occurs when the probability a given variable is missing depends on available and observed information only (Gelman & Hill, 2017, pg. 530). MAR is a weaker and more general classification of missingness than MCAR (Allison, 2012). The missing data model associated with MAR is defined as:

$$P(R=0|Y_{obs},Y_{mis},\psi) = P(R=0|Y_{obs},\psi)$$

For MAR, the missing data model reduces because the probability of data being missing depends on the missing data model and the observed data only. Therefore, $Y_{mis}$ does not affect the probability of missingness under MAR.

In the case of the weigh scale, MAR describes missing data that arises from the scale’s placement on hard or soft surfaces. If information about the surface (hard or soft) is fully observed for each attempted weight measurement, the probability of missing measurements then depends on available data - surface type - and thus falls under MAR  (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 1.2). Since MAR is a more general assumption than MCAR, it is more realistic to encounter in real-world datasets. 

#### Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

Missing not at random (MNAR) is the final missing data mechanism. MNAR suggests data’s “probability of being missing varies for reasons that are unknown to us” (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 1.2). As a result, the missing data model for MNAR does not reduce:

$$P(R=0|Y_{obs},Y_{mis},\psi)$$

Missing data under MNAR may depend on observed and unobserved data, so the missing data model does not simplify at all. There are two major sub-categories that capture "unobserved" within MNAR. First, missingness may depend on the actual missing values themselves (Gelman & Hill, 2017, pg. 530). When the weight of an object itself is to blame for a scale’s failure to report measurements, the underlying process falls under this sub-category of MNAR because the probability of weight being missing is related to weight itself (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 1.2). The second type of MNAR covers missingness that depends on unobserved measurements or latent variables (Gelman & Hill, 2017, pg. 530). The weigh scale example proposes three reasons a scale may generate missing measurements. These reasons do not cover countless other possibilities for why missing data may occur, such as the brand or age of a given scale. If the brand or age of a scale contributes to the probability of missing measurements but data is not available regarding a scale's brand or age, then the missing data mechanism falls under the second sub-category of MNAR. 

### Ignorability {#background-ignorability .unnumbered}

The missing data mechanism underpins the assumptions one can make when handling missing data. The most important assumption is that of **ignorability**. Missingness is ignorable “if it is missing at random and the probability of a missingness does not depend on the missing information itself” (Introduction to SAS, 2017). Therefore, the missingness within a dataset is said to be ignorable if the underlying missing data mechanism is MCAR or MAR. MNAR, on the other hand, constitutes missingness that is non-ignorable.

As Van Buuren notes, "the concept of ignorability plays an important role in the construction of imputation models" (2018, ch. 2.2.6). Specifically, ignorability determines whether one can ignore the way in which data are missing prior to imputing missing data through an imputation model (Nakagawa, 2015, Pg. 85). As stated in Introduction to SAS, “the assumption of ignorability is needed for optimal estimation of missing information and is a required assumption” (2017).

To formalize the statements above, consider the general expression for an imputation model:

$$P(Y_{mis}|Y_{obs}, R)$$

This expression means that the distribution of the missing data depends on the distribution of the observed data $Y_{obs}$ and the process that generated the missing data, $R$ (Van Buuren, 2018, ch 2.2.6). In the context of imputation, this expression suggests that the imputed values are generated conditional on the observed data and missing data mechanism.

If the missingness is ingorable, then:

$$P(Y|Y_{obs}, R=1) = P(Y|Y_{obs}, R=0)$$

This equality states that the distribution of the data $Y$ is the same for both the response (observed) and non-response (missing) groups (Van Buuren, 2018, ch 2.2.6). Essentially, this equation suggests that imputation models need not consider the missing data model when creating imputations for $Y_{mis}$. As a result, the parameters of the missing data model, $\psi$, are not important if the underlying missing data mechanism is ignorable.

The importance of this equality becomes clear through an example. Take the weigh scale experiment introduced in the beginning of the [Background section](#background). Assume $Y_{weight}$ contains weight measurements in $Y$, and $Y_{surface}$ specifies the surface (hard or soft) of the scale generating weight measurements. The researcher can model weight using the observed data only within each surface: $P(Y_{weight}|Y_{surface}=hard, R=1)$ and $P(Y_{weight}|Y_{surface}=soft, R=1)$. If the missing data mechanism is ignorable, then $P(Y_{weight}|Y_{surface}=hard, R=1)$ = $P(Y_{weight}|Y_{surface}=hard, R=0)$ for hard surfaces and $P(Y_{weight}|Y_{surface}=soft, R=1)$ = $P(Y_{weight}|Y_{surface}=soft, R=0)$ for soft surfaces. Therefore, the researcher can draw imputations for weight conditional on observed data only; he or she does not need to consider the missing data model within each subgroup, because the distribution for the observed and the missing data is the same (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 2.2.6). Thus, the researcher can focus on the impact of the scale surface alone, as missing values for weight come from the same distribution as the observed.

If within each surface group the distribution for missing weights depends further on the actual mass of the object weighed, then the researcher cannot ignore the missing data model, because imputed values drawn from the observed data would be systematically different than the distribution of imputed values drawn when taking the missing data model into consideration. In this example, if weight were missing for objects that had a higher weight, imputations drawn from the observed data would systematically understate the weight of the missing objects regardless of the surface of the scale if the missing data model is ignored. The resulting imputations would be (potentially severly) biased depending on how influential the missing data model actually is.

Therefore, the implications of ignorability are of utmost importance when building an imputation model. Most imputation models in literature assume that the missing data mechanism is ignorable. Imputation models relying on this assumption produced unbiased imputations if the assumption of ignorability holds. In the event that it does not hold, imputations may be systematically biased.

The imputation models introduced in subsequent sections operate under the assumption that the missing data mechanism is ignorable (MCAR or MAR). The important takeaway, however, is that the researcher considers the missing data mechanism responsible for generating missing data and understands the effect of the missing data model on an imputation model's ability to generate unbiased imputations. If the practicioner is aware of the potential consequences that stem from the missing data mechansim at hand, he or she is prepared to assess the benefits and drawbacks of each imputation model applied to a given dataset.

This section establishes a firm understanding of the concepts related to missing data and their implications. For an extended examination, consult Appendix C. Next, the authors review popular imputation models in literature and those supported in the `Autoimpute` package. All the models assume ignorability, so methods for non-ignorable missingness are out of scope. For interested readers, many studies cover non-ignorable missingness and its impact on the models presented in this research. **(ADD SOURCES HERE TO REFER TO)**. 

## Missing Data Methods {#background-missing-data-methods .unnumbered} 

Missing data mechanisms that satisfy ignorability provide the foundation for the missing data methods explored throughout the rest of this research. With an understanding of these concepts, one can now examine the imputation methods built upon these assumptions as well as the effect of those methods on supervised analysis.

Before the authors examine missing data methods, they clarify some terminology upfront to avoid confusion later on:

* A **missing data method** is a strategy to handle missing data. The two types of methods are deletion and imputation.
* An **imputation model** is a strategy used to impute missing data. Imputation models are missing data methods within the imputation category.
* An **analysis model** is a machine learning model that a researcher wants to apply to an underlying dataset. Because analysis models require complete data, the practicioner must perform either deletion or imputation to enable an analyis model to run.

The sections below define and explore imputation models. In doing so, the authors reference the effect a given imputation model may have when subsequent analysis is performed. That being said, the researchers devote an entire section to analysis models after a full review of missing data methods.

### Deletion {#background-deletion .unnumbered}

One of the most popular missing data methods that data practitioners use when dealing with missing data is listwise deletion or complete-case analysis (CCA). Listwise deletion discards all rows in which at least one value in the columnspace of $Y$ is missing for a given record (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 1.3.1). Complete-case analysis (CCA) is relatively easy to implement and enables analysis models to run without the need for imputation because missing data has been removed. However, CCA also has its flaws. As Gelman & Hill (2017) describe, two problems arise with CCA:

1. If the units with missing values differ systematically from the completely observed cases, this could bias the complete-case analysis.  
2. If many variables are included in a model, there may be very few complete cases, so that most of the data would be discarded for the sake of a simple analysis. (p. 531)

The first hypothetical results from the strong assumptions listwise deletion makes regarding the missing data mechansim. CCA requies missing data to not only be ignorable but also MCAR in most cases. Therefore, listwise deletion can result in biased estimates even if ignorability holds but MAR is not met (Introduction to SAS, 2017).

The second hypothetical addresses the impact of removing observations from a dataset. Removing records from a dataset can drastically reduce the sample size if enough records have missing data. Small sample sizes can cause problems in parameter inference from supervised machine learning model analysis. Smaller samples reduce statistical power and, as a result, inflate the standard error of analysis model coefficients. If standard error increases enough, coefficients may become statistically insignificant in an analysis model (Introduction to SAS, 2017).

### Imputation {#background-imputation .unnumbered}

Because of these problems, researchers are cautious with listwise deletion and employ CCA as a benchmark or in specific cases where the effect from deletion is negligible. Instead, researchers turn to imputation in most cases to handle missing data. UNECE provides the following definition: “Imputation is a procedure for entering a value for a specific data item where the response is missing or unusable” (2000). Instead of discarding data, imputation retains potentially important information in the data by substituting missing values with plausible ones produced from an imputation model.

While this process seems straightforward, numerous imputation models exist and range from quite simple methods to very complex models. Furthermore, no universal evaluation metric exists to judge the accuracy or success of an imputation technique because the performance of an imputation model is often contextual, depending on the nature of the missing data beyond the missing data mechanism. Because of these reasons, practitioners must fully understand the different imputation options available to them and perform imputation analysis to discern which method serves their use case to best meet their objectives. The next section explores the fundamentals behind different imputation methods and examines their respective strengths and weaknesses. 

In general, there are two major categories of imputation methods - **univariate** and **multivariate**.

#### Univariate

Univariate imputation techniques focus on a single incomplete variable known as the target variable (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 3). Univariate methods utilize observed values in the target variable to determine how to fill in missing values in the same target. Mean imputation is a popular example of a univariate method. When applied, mean imputation takes the mean of the observed features within a target variable and imputes missing values with the mean. This imputation method extends to any descriptive statistic that one can calculate from a single target variable’s observed data. Additional examples include median and mode imputation, which follow a similar process but use a different statistic for imputation.

Univariate measures do not have to impute a single static value. For example, linear interpolation employs linear curve fitting to construct imputations for missing values between two observed data points. Therefore, imputations from linear interpolation depend upon the closest observed values, so the value of an imputation will differ from one section of the data to another. 

The only requirement for univariate methods is that they use information contained within the observed values of the same variable they are designed to impute. Appendix D goes into greater detail of all the univariate methods that the researchers support in `Autoimpute`. 

#### Multivariate

The second major category of imputation methods is multivariate imputation. Multivariate imputation methods rely on one or more available features to predict plausible imputations for the target variable. When an imputation model has access to multiple features within a dataset, the method can preserve the relationships between the features and the target variable (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 4.1). While this preservation is beneficial, it is not always clear which features one should use in a multivariate imputation model. In this case, the **missing data pattern** becomes useful to know. Van Buuren (2018) states:

> The missing data pattern influences the amount of information that can be transferred between variables. Imputation can be more precise if other variables are non-missing for those cases that are to be imputed. The reverse is also true. Predictors are potentially more powerful if they have are non-missing in rows that are vastly incomplete. (ch. 4.1.2)

Since the missing data pattern shows how information can be transferred between variables, we can now calculate quantitative statistics to determine further how each variable connects to one another. Van Buuren (2018) names the first of these statistics **Influx**. The influx coefficient $I_j$ is defined as:

$$I_j = \frac{\sum_j^p\sum_k^p\sum_i^n (1-r_{ij})r_{ik}}{\sum_k^p\sum_i^n r_{ik}}$$

Influx represents the number of variable pairs ($Y_j$,$Y_k$) with $Y_j$ missing and $Y_k$ observed, divided by the total number of observed data points. Its value depends on the proportion of missing data of the variable, where $I_j=0$ when a variable is completely observed and $I_j=1$ when a variable is completely missing (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 4.1.3). As Van Buuren notes, "for two variables with the same proportion of missing data, the variable with higher influx is better connected to the observed data, and might thus be easier to impute" (2018, ch. 4.1.3). Thus, influx is an important statistic that suggests which variables in the dataset are good candidates to be imputed using the other variables as predictors.

Van Buuren (2018) coins a similar coefficient of interest, named **Outflux**. The outflux coefficient $O_j$ is defined as:

$$O_j = \frac{\sum_j^p\sum_k^p\sum_i^n r_{ij}(1-r_{ik})}{\sum_k^p\sum_i^n 1-r_{ij}}$$
The outflux coefficient $O_j$ is the number of variable pairs with ($Y_j$,$Y_k$) with $Y_j$ observed and $Y_k$ missing, divided by the total number of incomplete data points. Its value indicates the potential usefulness of $Y_j$ for imputing other variables. As with influx, outflux depends on the proportion of missing data of the variable. Unlike influx, $O_j=1$ when a variable is completely observed, and $O_j=0$ when a variable is completely missing (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 4.1.3). Van Buuren describes outflux in a similar manner to influx: "For two variables having the same proportion of missing data, the variable with higher outflux is better connected to the missing data, and thus potentially more useful for imputing other variables" (ch. 4.1.3). Accordingly, outflux recommends variables that are potentially more useful as predictors when imputing missing value variables in a multivariate missing dataset. 

Practitioners use the above statistics to understand the importance of and relationships between variables that contain missing values. Once the set of variables is identified, a multivariate imputation model can be specified, and predictions from that model impute missing values in a target variable. A few examples of multivariate imputation methods are:

* Linear and Logistic Regression Imputation
* Bayesian Regression Imputation
* Predictive Mean Matching (PMM)
* Local Residual Draws (LRD)

Appendix E provides more information regarding multivariate imputation methods available in `Autoimpute` and detail behind how each method works under the hood. `Autoimpute` implements regressions as seen in Van Buuren and implements PMM and LRD as seen in Morris et. al.

## Single Imputation {#background-single-imputation .unnumbered}

NOTES HERE ON SINGLE IMPUTATION USING THE METHODS ABOVE

## Multiple Imputation {#background-multiple-imputation .unnumbered} 

With univariate and multivariate imputation methods, practitioners now have the ability to impute missing values in a dataset. These methods impute missing values once, however, and provide a single point estimate - the imputation - for each missing value. Gelman & Hill (2017) argue “whenever a single imputation strategy is used, the standard errors of estimates tend to be too low. The intuition here is that we have substantial uncertainty about the missing values, but by choosing a single imputation we in essence pretend that we know the true value with certainty” (p. 532). To account for this issue, researchers developed a procedure called multiple imputation.

As noted in the Introduction to SAS:

> Multiple imputation is essentially an iterative form of stochastic imputation. However, instead of filling in a single value, the distribution of the observed data is used to estimate multiple values that reflect the uncertainty around the true value. These values are then used in the analysis of interest, such as in a OLS model, and the results combined. Each imputed value includes a random component whose magnitude reflects the extent to which other variables in the imputation model cannot predict it’s true values (Johnson and Young, 2011; White et al, 2010). Thus, building into the imputed values a level of uncertainty around the “truthfulness” of the imputed values. (2017)

Therefore, multiple imputation provides a solution to the definite nature of single imputation point estimates. Specifically, multiple imputation includes three major steps in developing a multiply imputed datasets (Allison, 2012):

1. Introduce random variation into the process of imputing missing values, and generate several data sets, each with slightly different imputed values.   
2. Perform an analysis on each of the data sets using the analysis model one would have used had the dataset been complete.  
3. Combine the results into a single set of parameter estimates, standard errors, and test statistics using parameter pooling techniques.  

Figure 1 below visualizes the workflow described in the three steps above (Van Buuren, 2018, ch. 1.4.1).

```{r mutlipleimputationworkflow, echo=FALSE, out.width="400px", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Multiple Imputation Workflow"}
include_graphics(path = "figure/multiple-imputation-workflow.jpg")
```

Based on the data, use-case, and desired outcome, practitioners should choose an imputation method that adds some random variation. Then multiple imputation results in multiple copies of imputed datasets with different imputed values. Each imputed dataset is analyzed separately and then parameters from those analyses are pooled together to get combined diagnostics on the performance of the multiple imputation process and the specified imputation model. This method “solves the standard error problem by calculating the variance of each parameter estimate across the several data sets” (Allison, 2012). The pooled parameters replace those from the supervised machine learning model of interest. The pooled parameters not only produce the coefficient estimate but also the properly account for the increase in standard error due to uncertainty introduced from imputing missing data.

## Missing Data and Autoimpute {#background-missing-data-autoimpute .unnumbered}

Ultimately, this background details the concepts and theory that are the foundation for the Autoimpute package. Understanding the process that generates missingness in a dataset - the missing data mechanism - is imperative prior to applying any deletion or imputation method. The missing data mechanism and missing data pattern should inform which strategy to use to handle missing data. At that point, the researcher performs either univariate or multivariate imputation using the method that fits best a given dataset, use case, or goal. If the researcher is interested in analysis, then he or she should deploy the selected imputation method in multiple imputations. Each imputed dataset within the multiple imputation framework can then be analyzed separately with the supervised learning model of interest. Finally, the researcher can pool parameters together to produce parameters of the multiply imputed analysis model and use this model to make predictions when new data arrives.

Anyone interested can utilize `Autoimpute`, the Python package created by the authors, to perform all of the steps described above. The next section discusses how to use `Autoimpute` from end-to-end to explore and analyze missing data. It also demonstrates the impact different missing data mechanisms have on the results produced from multiple imputation and subsequent analysis. All results are generated using the `Autoimpute` package.
